Add a Want button to your website, very similar to the implementation at wantbutton.com

== Description ==

Quickly add the Want button to get on Facebook Timeline!

Other than “buy now” there is no better expression for a retailer than “Want”!

Increase Sharing
Facebook’s Open Graph 2.0 allows for more expressive verbs beyond Like. Want is the preeminent action for commerce and naturally attracts higher click rates than Like. Publishers have seen their Facebook sharing increase by 200% since adding Want.

Gain Impressions
Every Wanted item is posted to Timeline, Newsfeed, and Ticker where it on average receives 97 impressions. Wants are also showcased in a dedicated Timeline box where they will gain constant exposure.

More Click-throughs
All of these impressions increase referral traffic back to your website. Want sharing has boosted the average publishers Facebook traffic by 50%.
